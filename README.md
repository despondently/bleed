# bleed

> An open-source replication of the Discord bot "bleed"

# Notice

- This project is currently a work in progress and should not be utilized at this time.
- I'll be working on this bot every day, so be sure to star this repository so you can always check back and see updates.

# Why?

The inspiration for starting this project derives from my personal experience with the owner, jonathan, also known as jon, who has harassed me (on alts) and several other bot creators on the Discord application.

Bleed isn't a great bot; every egirl buys it just to seem hip, the antinuke hasn't been updated since 2020, and jon just removes the bot or blacklistsÂ particular servers from utilizing the bot due to a personal feud with someone.

I don't suggest buying bleed since doing so would just feed the egocentric tendencies of its developer, who doesn't have any redeeming traits than bragging about the money he's made through bleed.
